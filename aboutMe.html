          <p class="text-center">
            David Rushton opened Fun House Pizza on February 11, 1968. It has
            been a staple in the Kansas City metro area for years. We are family
            owned and are an independent chain.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-center display-4">OUR PURPOSE</h3>
          <p class="text-center">
            Our objective has been the same since we first opened our doors. We
            want our customers to enjoy great pizza at a family orient location.
            A place where families can come together. A place where kids can
            celebrate a victory after a local sports event. A place where
            children and adults can celebrate birthdays.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3 class="text-center display-4">OUR VALUES</h3>
          <p class="text-center">
            We value tradition here at Fun House Pizza. Not much has changed
            since we first opened over 50 years ago and I'm sure that many of
            our cutomers like it that way. Loyal customers who grew up visiting
            our restaraunt as children are now bringing their children here.
            They can look back fondly on old times while their kids sat in the
            same bench as they did or play the same games. Our great tasting
            pizza is still hand made and cooked in the same ovens that they were
            over 50 years ago.
